Thank you for your interest in contributing. This document explains how to get involved.

## How to contribute

### Reporting bugs

Search [existing issues](https://github.com/smelicit1-debug/claw-in-the-tank/issues) before opening a new one. If you find a match, add any additional information as a comment rather than opening a duplicate.

When opening a bug report, use the bug report template and include:
- steps to reproduce the problem
- your OS, installation method, and Claw in the Tank version
- relevant log output (`docker logs claw-in-the-tank`)

### Requesting features

Open a feature request issue using the feature request template. Describe the problem you are trying to solve, not just the solution. This helps us evaluate whether the feature fits the project's direction.

### Submitting pull requests

Pull requests are welcome. Please open an issue first to discuss the change before investing time in an implementation — this avoids wasted effort if the direction does not align.

When your PR is ready:
- reference the related issue (`Closes #NNN`)
- keep the scope focused; one fix or feature per PR
- make sure existing tests still pass
- add tests for new behavior where applicable

## Coding standards

- Python: match the style of the existing codebase in `forks/hermes-webui/`
- JavaScript: plain ES2020 modules, no TypeScript, no bundler
- Shell scripts: `set -euo pipefail` at the top of every script
- Commit messages: use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, etc.)
- Do not leave debug logging (`console.log`, `print`) in committed code
- Do not hardcode paths — use environment variables or the `/data` mount point
